map ka use krke last time humne ek line se hi kayi saare cards bna diye the,
    iss bar bhi map ka use krke kayi saare filter bna rhe hi

    return statement ka use kro , 

Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

    resolved this error , this comes when we not export from component are using it. 
    also  I got error due to using function , directly , so I am using arrow function
