When you pass `setCategory` as a prop to a child component in React, you are essentially passing down the state setter function that was returned from a `useState` call. This allows the child component to update the state that is managed by the parent component. Here's an example to illustrate this:

### Parent Component
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Filter from './Filter';
import Cards from './Cards';

const ParentComponent = () => {
    const [category, setCategory] = useState('All');
    const filterData = [/* your filter data here */];
    const courses = {
        "Web Development": [{ id: 1, name: "React" }, { id: 2, name: "Vue" }],
        "Data Science": [{ id: 3, name: "Python" }, { id: 4, name: "R" }]
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <Filter filterData={filterData} category={category} setCategory={setCategory} />
            <Cards category={category} courses={courses} />
        </div>
    );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

### Child Component (Filter)
In the `Filter` component, you can now call `setCategory` to update the state in the parent component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Filter = ({ filterData, category, setCategory }) => {//& either you receive like this , or recieve it by props object.
    const handleCategoryChange = (newCategory) => {
        setCategory(newCategory);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            {filterData.map((filter) => (
                <button
                    key={filter}
                    onClick={() => handleCategoryChange(filter)}
                    className={filter === category ? 'active' : ''}
                >
                    {filter}
                </button>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export default Filter;
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Management in Parent**: The parent component (`ParentComponent`) manages the state `category` and its setter function `setCategory`.
2. **Passing Props**: The parent passes `category` and `setCategory` to the child component (`Filter`) via props.
3. **Updating State from Child**: The `Filter` component receives `setCategory` as a prop and can call it to update the `category` state in the parent component. For example, clicking a button in the `Filter` component calls `setCategory` with the new category value.
4. **Re-rendering**: When `setCategory` is called, it updates the state in the parent component, causing a re-render. The new state value (`category`) is passed down again to both `Filter` and `Cards` components, ensuring they are rendered with the updated state.

By passing the state setter function (`setCategory`) to the child component, you enable the child component to modify the state of the parent component, facilitating a more interactive and responsive UI.
